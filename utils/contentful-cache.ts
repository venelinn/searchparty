 * ALL of them at once. Keep this string identical here and in
 * `utils/revalidation.ts`.

/**
 * Wrap any async Contentful fetch so its result is cached **indefinitely**
 * (`revalidate: false`) and only refetched when the publish webhook busts the
 * `contentful` tag.
 *
 * This is the core of the "pure-webhook" model: ordinary traffic and crawlers
 * hit the cache and spend ZERO Contentful API calls. The CMS is queried only
 * (a) at build time and (b) once per cache entry after an editor publishes —
 * never on a timer (no numeric `revalidate` anywhere), never per visitor.
 *
 * The cache is bypassed when:
 * - `opts.bypass` is set — used for preview / draft mode, which must always read
 *   fresh draft content.
 *
 * In `next dev` we DON'T use `unstable_cache` (it persists to `.next/cache` on
 * disk and would survive restarts). Instead we memoize in-process for the
 * lifetime of the dev server: repeated requests and hot reloads cost ZERO
 * Contentful calls, and a full server restart clears the memo — so restarting
 * is how you pick up freshly published content while developing.
 *
 * `keyParts` MUST uniquely identify the result — include EVERY argument that
 * changes it (content type, locale, slug, query params). Two different inputs
 * sharing a key would serve the wrong content from cache.
